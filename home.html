    <h2>Curiosity Killed the Developer</h2>
    <p>
        So you want to know a little more about zombies.  Who <strong>doesn't??</strong><br />
        Zombies are in popular culture all around us.
        Take this <a href="https://youtu.be/sOnqjkJTMaA" target="_blank">classic</a>, for example.
        Or <a href="https://youtu.be/HcwTxRuq-uk" target="_blank">this</a>, for something a little more recent.
        Since the beginning of recorded history, humanity has been obsessed with life and death.  Zombies are another manifestation of that obsession.
        Zombies take the usual cycle of life and death and turn it on its head.  Not only that, but they actively seek to upend that same cycle for everything else still living.
        Zombies are a monkey wrench in the wheel of life.  But how likely is it that a real-life zombie event will ever take place?

    <h2>Should I Start Prepping My Survival Kit?</h2>
    <p>
        Popular consensus among the scientific community says no.  It will probably never happen.
        That hasn't stopped the CDC from releasing a <a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2011/05/preparedness-101-zombie-apocalypse/" target="_blank">detailed zombie survival kit</a>, though.
        And according to the experts over at Cracked, <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-scientific-reasons-zombie-apocalypse-could-actually-happen.html" target="_blank">anything is possible</a>.
        It's better to be safe than sorry!!
